	<step name="Learn more about RapidMiner AI Hub.">
		<text>RapidMiner AI Hub is the component that allows you to run demanding processes on a dedicated machine and create a collaboration space where you can share processes, models and experience with your colleagues. </text>
		<info>RapidMiner AI Hub provides a common repository for multiple users. It is a secure environment where you can control who sees or executes what and keep version control. It is also a dedicated execution platform where you can run or schedule your jobs.</info>
	</step>
		<step name="Check your installation data.">
		<text>The first step is to check whether you have all the needed information to connect to your RapidMiner AI Hub. If you don't have a RapidMiner AI Hub installation, the first step is to download and install from  <link url="https://rapidminer.com/download">here.</link> Check also our <link url="https://redirects.rapidminer.com/web/server/installation-guide">documentation.</link></text>
		<info>What you need to know before connecting to the RapidMiner AI Hub is: </info>
			<text><point>The AI Hub's URL (something like http://[your host name]:8080).</point>
			<point>Your user and password. </point></text>
			<text>	This information should be provided by the system administrator.</text>
	</step>
	<step name="Connect to a RapidMiner AI Hub and create your process.">
	<text>Connect to a RapidMiner AI Hub (log into the repository).</text>
		<tasks>
			<task><activity>Find</activity> the <ui>Repository</ui> panel on the left of the screen.</task>
			<task>In the top right <ui>drop-down menu</ui>, select  <activity>Create / Connect to Repository</activity>, and then <ui>RapidMiner AI Hub repository</ui>.</task>
			<task><activity>Fill </activity>in the connection data. The <ui>Alias</ui> is the name you choose for the connection. The <ui>Repository URL</ui> should be given by your administrator. Then <activity>type </activity>your <ui>User</ui> and <ui>Password</ui>. After that, <activity>click </activity> on <ui>Check connection settings</ui>.</task>
			<task>If successful, just press <activity>Finish</activity>.</task>
		</tasks>
		<info>Good job! You have just connected to the RapidMiner AI Hub. Now letâ€™s see what you can do with it!</info>
	</step>
	<step name="Browse the repository to verify the connection.">
	<text>Now it's time to check the connection. <activity>Find</activity> the <ui>Repository</ui> panel on the left of the screen. You should see your connection as an additional repository on the list.</text>
		<tasks>
			<task><activity>Double click </activity>on the connection.</task>
			<task>In a few seconds, the folder tree will open and you'll be able to<activity> browse </activity> through it.</task>
			<task>Create a new folder in your home directory. We'll use it in the following steps.</task>
		</tasks>
		<info>Great! You have successfully connected to the RapidMiner AI Hub.</info>
	</step>
	<step name="Work with the RapidMiner AI Hub's repository.">
	<text>Let's create a process now.</text>
		<tasks>
			<task><activity>Drag and drop</activity> the <op>Generate Data</op> operator to the canvas.</task>
			<task><activity>Drag and drop</activity> the <op>Store</op> operator to the canvas.</task>
			<task><activity>Connect</activity> the output of <op>Generate Data</op> to the input of <op>Store</op>.</task>
			<task><activity>Configure </activity>the <op>Store</op> operator to save the data in the AI Hub's repository by just providing any name for the repository entry (by default it will be saved in the same folder as the process). Also, for this tutorial we recommend a name like "result_%{t}". The last part is a macro variable that will be replaced with the execution time. This way we can repeat the executions and see results easily.</task>
			<task><activity>Save </activity> the process in the same AI Hub folder by using the "Save process as..." menu and browsing to the right location.</task>
		</tasks>
		<info>Now our processes are located on the AI Hub and can be executed and shared.</info>
	</step>
	<step name="Understand permissions.">
		<text>We have a our process, but maybe we need to control who can access it. Let us see how we can achieve that.</text>
		<tasks>
			<task>In the AI Hub's repository, <activity>browse </activity> to your recently created process.</task>
			<task><activity>Right-click</activity> on it and select <ui>Edit Access Rights</ui>. You can grant or deny permissions to other users. That way, you can control who can see, modify, and execute your process. Cancel if you don't want to change anything.</task>
		</tasks>
		<info>Now you can configure process and folder permissions. We are getting there!</info>
		<info>Now our processes are located on the AI Hub and can be executed and shared.</info>
	</step>
	<step name="Run and Schedule a process.">
		<text>We have been working with a process, but now it's time to run it and see the results.</text>
		<tasks>
			<task>Use the drop-down menu from the arrow to the right of the <icon>16/media_play.png</icon> <ui>Run</ui> button</task>
			<task>Several options appear, we are interested in <ui>Run Process on AI Hub</ui>. <activity>Select</activity> it.</task>
			<task>The process is scheduled for immediate execution on the RapidMiner AI Hub. As opposed to what happens when running from Studio, no result comes back, but we have stored the results and we can check. </task>
			<task><activity> Browse </activity> the repository again and locate the result file in the folder that you created. You may need to refresh the folder (F5).</task>
			<task>Now, use again the drop-down menu from the arrow to the right of the <icon>16/media_play.png</icon> <ui>Run</ui> button, but this time, <ui>Schedule Process on AI Hub</ui>.</task>
			<task>A new window is opened and you can select the AI Hub, queue, and schedule. Try to schedule the process once in 5 minutes from now.</task>
			<task>Wait until the scheduling is run and you'll see the results in your folder.</task>
		</tasks>
		<info>You have run a process on the RapidMiner AI Hub, and by doing so, you have freed your personal computer from the most demanding tasks.</info>

	<step name="Congratulations!">
		<text>Well done - you have gone through the RapidMiner AI Hub tutorial. To quickly review:
			<point>You have connected to a RapidMiner AI Hub instance</point>
			<point>You have created and stored a process</point>
			<point>You have configured permissions</point>
			<point>You have run and scheduled the process and you have checked the results</point>
		</text>
			<text>Congratulations! If you want to dive deeper, you can try some of the following challenges:</text>
		<questions>
			<question>Can you schedule your process to run every hour?</question>
			<question>Can you create a process that reads data from the AI Hub, transforms it and stores it in a different folder?</question>
			<question>Can you configure security so that your colleagues can see everything in one of your folders, but not in another?</question>
